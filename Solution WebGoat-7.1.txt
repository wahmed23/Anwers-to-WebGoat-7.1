Start OWASP Proxy and open a browser (I am using firefox) that is preconfigured to send traffic via ZAP.


1. Access Control Flaws:
  1.1 Using an Access Control Matrix:
  A.   Set break point on your ZAP for all traffic by clicking the green round button
       Check access through user "Shemp" and you are done

  1.2 Bypass a Path based access Control Scheme
  A.  Set break point on ZAP.
      Change the variable "File" in your request that is sent to the server to "../../../../../WEB-INF/spring-security.xml"

  1.3 Bypass Business layer access Control
  A.  For starters, the password for user "Tom Cat" would be "tom"
      Log in as "Larry Stooge" with password "larry"
      Using ZAP, change the "employee_ID" to "105" as this is the ID of "Tom Cat"
      change the "action" parameter to "DeleteProfile". This will delete Tom Cat's profile.

2. Ajax security:
   2.1 DOM Injection
   A.  Write anything in the box in front of "License Key"
       When you intercept the traffic from server replace the body with "document.form.SUBMIT.disabled=false". You may to have to do this on all the replies that you intercept from the server
   2.2 DOM-Based cross-site scripting
   A.  Stage1: <img src="images/logos/owasp.jpg"/>
       Stage2: <img src=x onerror=;;alert('XSS')/>
       Stage3: <iframe src="javascript:alert('XSS');"/>
       Stage4: Enter the html script showed
       Stage5: ONly available for developer version
   2.3 XML Injection
   A.  Intercept the traffic towards the server and change the parameters:
      "check1001" to "check1004" or "check1005"
