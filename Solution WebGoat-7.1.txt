Start OWASP Proxy and open a browser (I am using firefox) that is preconfigured to send traffic via ZAP.


1. Access Control Flaws:
  1.1 Using an Access Control Matrix:
  A.   Set break point on your ZAP for all traffic by clicking the green round button
       Check access through user "Shemp" and you are done

  1.2 Bypass a Path based access Control Scheme
  A.  Set break point on ZAP.
      Change the variable "File" in your request that is sent to the server to "../../../../../WEB-INF/spring-security.xml"
